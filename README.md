In this project, myself and two collaborators plan to use administrative data from Norway to
answer one of the key questions in economics: How much of the changes in wealth,
consumption, employment status, and other measures of economic well-being are due to
changes in the economy as a whole (“aggregate shocks” – think about changes in monetary
policy, for example) vs changes in the idiosyncratic situation faced by individuals (e.g., an
unexpected illness).

Why is this an important question? If the main determinants of adverse changes to, say, income
are individual-specific rather than economy-wide, then governments or markets could devise
insurance schemes to lessen the impact of these changes. Our analysis will provide a first step
to answer this question.

One of the collaborators on this project works at the statistical office of Norway and has access
to anonymized data from Norwegian tax returns. Norway has a wealth tax, so these tax returns
feature rich information on asset holdings that is missing from comparable datasets in the
United States, making this a unique dataset that is now explored more and more in economics.
In particular, this data set allows us to compute reliable measure of consumption spending for
the entire Norwegian population, something that has alluded researchers working with US data.
This dataset has millions of observations per year, requiring us to adjust standard time series
tools to analyze these data. In terms of modeling, we are building on and extending previous
work of ours where we developed factor models to analyze data on various sectors of the US
economy. We plan to merge these methods with tools from Machine Learning that can more
efficiently exploit the large amount of data we have access to.
